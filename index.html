	  <p>My consultant was Sara, and she could not have been any better. It truly felt like she was a part of my group and we had all known her for a long time. I trusted her judgement and tried on a dress I would have never picked up ... and it was my dress!!! I am just so thrilled, I came in with a small army and we were all treated so kindly like we had millions to spend there. I want to go back just to hang out with them lol!!! Thank you so much Ballett's Bridal.</p>

	  <p>Had such an amazing experience here. We walked in off the street, no appointment, close to closing time and the staff weren't fazed or annoyed at all. Alice was bright and full of smiles. We had the entire upstairs to ourselves, with a giant change room and an entire room of mirrors. She laced me up instead of just clipping the dress together, which let me see what the back would really look like. She was right there when we needed her and yet she also knew when not to give us space. Not only did we find the perfect dress, it was under my price point. They are able to get a brand new dress from the designer before this August - shipped right to my home in BC. A hug from Alice as we left was just the perfect ending to the day. Thank you Alice!</p>

	  <p> I ended up buying my wedding dress from Ballett's Bridal Shop yesterday. After having a disappointing experience at another shop in the area, I wandered over to Ballett's Bridal (without an appointment) and had a much better dress shopping experience! The staff were polite, down to earth and not pushy. I did not feel rushed and appreciated that I could try on a dress without a staff member helping me into it. All in all very happy with my purchase and would recommend this bridal shop to others!</p>

		<p> I was very nervous about dress shopping and was not sure what to expect. Genevieve was amazing. She showed us around the store and then let us just pull whatever dress we liked. She also suggested two, one of which ended up being the one the one I chose. She made me feel incredibly comfortable and kept the appointment very easy going. We had lots of laughs. I was not expecting to find my dress but we found the one that I just cannot live without. She made an experience that I was very stressed about a fun, easy going, comfortable, great memory for myself and those involved.</p>

		<p> I went all over the KW area looking for a dress, and found mine at Ballett's Bridal! The dress that I found was a dream come true, everyone was complimenting me on it all night, and the staff were so friendly and so helpful. We were helped by a girl named Tuyanna, and when me and my bridesmaids left my first appointment, they said that it was like we had all been friends for a long time, she was so friendly!</p>

		<p>I just ordered my dress at Ballett's St. Catharines location. I had come in with my mom earlier this month and we both fell in love with the first dress Brittany pulled for me. She listened to what I wanted and found the perfect dress in my budget! After shopping around a bit we returned today and Rita helped me try it on again and place the order. All of the ladies were wonderfully helpful and friendly and made the experience so much fun. Thank you!!!</p>

		<p>After visiting several other stores, I found my dress at the London location! Consultant Vanessa was extremely helpful, professional and easy to talk to at both appointments, and she went above and beyond my expectations by staying an hour after store closing once I had chosen my dress! Not once did she seem upset about staying late, but she made sure I saw the dress in both bright and evening lighting, took pictures with my entourage, answered all my questions and sorted out all the order details! A+ customer service for sure!</p>

				<p>I made an appointment at the Kitchener location. My consultant was Rhonda. She made the experience. My mom, sister and I just love her. When we arrived it looked like all the employees had been run off their feet. It was so busy. Rhonda made me feel like I was a priority. I fell in love with the second dress I tried on. I ended up purchasing that dress after comparing others. Rhonda still got me to try on others so I could make an informed decision and I love her for that! Can't wait to see her when my dress comes in and I go pick it up! Here's to hoping I win my dress for free today !! Haha. Thank you a million times over Rhonda. You are loved!</p>

				<p>Found my wedding dress at Ballett's Bridal in St. Catharines. Lots of options based both on your personal style preference and budget. :) Rita did an amazing job keeping me at ease with all the excitement and matching my style with what looks great for my figure. Plus the dress came in under budget which was also fantastic!</p>
